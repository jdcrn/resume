        <h1>Hi!</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="myName">
        <h3>My name is Joshua Curry.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="introduction">
        <p>I can design, develop, and host a custom website to give your business a polished, professional web presence. But that's just what I do to get started.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="simple">
        <p>your new website can be simple...</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dynamic">
        <p>or I can make it dynamic!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mobile">
        your website will always be optimized for mobile devices (like this one is, check it out) because <i>that's how people interact with the web.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="copy">
        <p>I also write <b>copy</b>, (the stuff you're reading right now) which is any text geared towards marketing. Right now I'm marketing myself, and I can use the same tools to market you or your business.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="maps">
        <p>Finally, it's important that you know that <b>Google Maps</b> is the Yellow Pages of the future. People make decisions on who to call and which service to use based on a business' presence on Google Maps and the reviews they see there. 
        I can help you build your presence on Google Maps and make you the kind of business that gets the first <i>and last</i> call.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <p>I am your one-man business solution. I'm also local, born and raised right here in Rochester, NY. Here's my phone number:</p>
        <p class="number">585-540-7565</p>
        <p>You can call me anytime. If I miss you, I'll call you back as soon as I can.</p>
        <p>Local support means you have someone you can talk to if your customers have issues with the website, or if you want to adjust something.</p>
        <h5 class="cta">You don't have to learn programming like I did to get a top notch website. I'll do it all for you!</h5>
